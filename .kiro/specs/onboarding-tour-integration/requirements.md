# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive onboarding tour system for the BrightRank dashboard application. The tour will guide new users through key features and interface elements after they complete the initial onboarding process. The system includes a welcome modal, interactive guided tour using React Joyride, and a help menu for restarting the tour.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user who has just completed onboarding, I want to see a welcome modal when I first access the dashboard, so that I can choose to take a guided tour of the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes onboarding and navigates to the dashboard for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a welcome modal
2. WHEN the welcome modal is displayed THEN it SHALL include the user's brand name and options to "Start Tour" or "Skip"
3. WHEN a user clicks "Start Tour" THEN the system SHALL close the modal and begin the guided tour
4. WHEN a user clicks "Skip" THEN the system SHALL close the modal and mark the tour as skipped in localStorage
5. IF a user has already completed or skipped the tour THEN the welcome modal SHALL NOT appear on subsequent visits

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user taking the guided tour, I want to see highlighted interface elements with explanatory tooltips, so that I can learn how to use each feature effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the guided tour starts THEN the system SHALL highlight the sidebar navigation area first
2. WHEN each tour step is active THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip with relevant information about the highlighted element
3. WHEN a tour step is displayed THEN the user SHALL be able to navigate to the next step, previous step, or skip the tour
4. WHEN the tour reaches the final step THEN the system SHALL mark the tour as completed in localStorage
5. WHEN the tour is completed or skipped THEN the system SHALL remove all tour overlays and highlights

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who has completed or skipped the tour, I want to access a help menu to restart the tour, so that I can review the interface guidance when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the help icon in the top bar THEN the system SHALL display a help menu
2. WHEN the help menu is displayed THEN it SHALL include an option to "Start Dashboard Tour"
3. WHEN a user clicks "Start Dashboard Tour" from the help menu THEN the system SHALL begin the guided tour from the first step
4. IF the user is not on the dashboard page THEN the system SHALL navigate to the dashboard before starting the tour
5. WHEN the tour is restarted from the help menu THEN it SHALL function identically to the initial tour experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user taking the tour, I want the tour to highlight specific dashboard elements in a logical sequence, so that I can understand the workflow and key features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tour begins THEN it SHALL follow this sequence: sidebar → navigation links → theme toggle → dashboard cards → controls → data table
2. WHEN highlighting the sidebar THEN the system SHALL explain the main navigation area
3. WHEN highlighting navigation links THEN the system SHALL explain each section (Dashboard, Analytics, Keywords, Competitors, Settings)
4. WHEN highlighting dashboard cards THEN the system SHALL explain the visibility score, mentions, and sentiment metrics
5. WHEN highlighting controls THEN the system SHALL explain the date selector and refresh functionality
6. WHEN highlighting the data table THEN the system SHALL explain the mentions tracker functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the tour to work responsively across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports, so that I can access the guidance regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tour runs on mobile devices THEN tooltips SHALL automatically adjust position to remain visible
2. WHEN the tour runs on different screen sizes THEN the overlay SHALL prevent interaction with non-tour elements
3. WHEN using touch devices THEN users SHALL be able to swipe through tour steps
4. WHEN the viewport changes during the tour THEN the tour SHALL adapt positioning without breaking
5. WHEN tour elements are not visible on smaller screens THEN the tour SHALL handle gracefully by skipping or adjusting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the tour, I want tour targets to be clearly marked with data attributes, so that the tour can reliably find and highlight interface elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing tour targets THEN each element SHALL have a unique `data-tour` attribute
2. WHEN the tour runs THEN it SHALL use CSS selectors based on `data-tour` attributes to find elements
3. WHEN tour target elements are not found THEN the tour SHALL handle gracefully without breaking
4. WHEN new tour steps are added THEN they SHALL follow the established `data-tour` naming convention
5. WHEN tour targets are modified THEN the changes SHALL not affect other functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my tour preferences to be remembered across browser sessions, so that I don't see the tour again after completing or skipping it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the tour THEN the system SHALL store 'true' in localStorage under 'brightrank_tour_completed'
2. WHEN a user skips the tour THEN the system SHALL store 'skipped' in localStorage under 'brightrank_tour_completed'
3. WHEN a user visits the dashboard with tour completion data THEN the welcome modal SHALL NOT appear
4. WHEN localStorage is cleared THEN the tour SHALL be available again for new users
5. WHEN the tour is restarted from the help menu THEN it SHALL not affect the completion status until finished again
