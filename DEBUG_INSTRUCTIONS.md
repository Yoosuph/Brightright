# Dashboard Debug Instructions

## The dashboard now has detailed console logging to help us identify the issue.

### Steps to Debug:

1. **Open your browser's Developer Console** (F12 or Right-click → Inspect → Console tab)

2. **Refresh the dashboard page** (or navigate to it again)

3. **Look for these log messages** in the console:

```
🔄 useEffect triggered
🚀 Calling runAnalysis from useEffect  
🔵 runAnalysis called
✅ Starting analysis...
📡 Calling getDashboardAnalysis...
📊 getDashboardAnalysis result: [object]
✅ Setting analysis result
✅ Analysis complete!
🏁 Setting isLoading to false
```

### What to look for:

**If you see:**
- ❌ "Missing brandName or keywords" → Your localStorage data is incomplete
- ❌ "No result from getDashboardAnalysis" → The mock service isn't returning data
- ❌ "Analysis failed" → There's an error in the async function
- ⚠️ "No appData" → localStorage doesn't have the required data
- 🔵 "runAnalysis called" repeating many times → Infinite loop (should be fixed)

### Quick Fixes:

#### If localStorage is empty or incomplete:
Open the browser console and run:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('brightRankData', JSON.stringify({
  brandName: "TestBrand",
  keywords: "AI, machine learning, automation",
  competitors: []
}));
location.reload();
```

#### If you see errors in the console:
Copy the entire error message and share it - we'll fix the specific issue.

### Expected Behavior:
After the logs finish, you should see:
- Loading animation disappear
- Dashboard cards populate with data
- Charts render
- No more console errors

### If the dashboard STILL doesn't load after seeing all the ✅ checkmarks:
There might be a rendering issue. Check if you see:
- "Analysis complete!" in the console
- isLoading set to false
- But the UI still shows loading placeholders

This would indicate a React state update issue rather than a data fetching issue.
